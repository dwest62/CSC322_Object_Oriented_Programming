/**
 * Question Answers:
 *
 * 1. Relationships between classes are an important part of Object-Oriented Programming because they allow for the
 * modeling of complex systems which contain many interconnected components at varying levels of abstraction and
 * specificity within an application.
 *
 * 2. An Association is a relationship between classes which involves an activity between the classes.
 *
 * 3. List the four types of Associations between two classes.
 * In reading the text, it was hard to find 4 clear types of Association. There was Aggregation, Composition, and
 * Inheritance was mentioned. According to https://www.javatpoint.com/uml-relationship, the 4 types are
 * bidirectional, unidirectional, aggregation (composition aggregation), and reflexive. I researched a few other
 * sites, but these seemed to be the clearest to me given the prompt.
 *


 * 4. Illustrate each of these relationships by writing a sentence for each one between an Employee class and a
 * Company class
 *
 * a) unidirectional: A Company hires a Employee.
 * b) bidirectional: A Company hires an Employee and an Employee works for a Company(s).
 * c) aggregation: A Company has an Employee.
 * d) reflexive: A Company has an Employee (e.g., the manager) who hires Employees.
 *
 * 5. These Associations mean that objects from one class can communicate with objects of another class, enabling
 * them to access data. Describe how a HAS-a relationship is created in OOP.
 *
 *
 *
 * 6. The two forms of Association are Aggregation and Composition. Describe both, highlighting the differences.
